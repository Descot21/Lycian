# The eliyAna, *spirits of water*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_07`

The eliyAna (𐊁𐊍𐊆𐊊𐊙𐊏𐊀) only appear in the Letoon trilingual where they are invoked alongside Eni and her children ("*sey Eni : qlahi : ebiyehi pNtrENni : se tideime : sey eliyAna*") as disciplinary agents against anyone who might violate the trilingual's inscription. The eliyAna were water spirits that were perhaps not too dissimilar to the naiads and water nymphs of Greek religion. This is supported by their equasion with the νύμφαι/nymphs in the Greek portion of the trilingual,<sup>1</sup> and the the Luwian root of their name, *ali-h<sub>3</sub>on-* "having water."<sup>2</sup> The eliyAna's presence in the Letoon furthers the theory that early cult functions around Xanthos were centered around a spring sanctuary, and that Eni (and later Leto) shared cultic functions with the eliyAna at the Letoon.<sup>3</sup>
