# pedrita, *the Lycian Aphrodite*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_12`

pedrita's identification with the Greek Aphrodite comes from a silver kantharos depicting the judgment of Paris (N 307) where she sits beside maliya/Athena. Furthermore, her Lycian name shows a clear borrowing from the Greek name with an common Anatolian aphaeresis of initial a-.<sup>1</sup>. This indicates that she was a direct import from Greece without a native Anatolian counterpart.<sup>2</sup> In terms of cult, the Xanthos Stele (TL 44.b, 53) makes reference to a *komeziya padritahi* (𐊋𐊒𐊎𐊁𐊈𐊆𐊊𐊀 𐊓𐊀𐊅𐊕𐊆𐊗𐊀𐊛𐊆), or an "altar of padrita," which suggests that there may be have been established cultic functions around pedrita by the end of the 5th century BCE.<sup>3</sup> Howevever, another scholar has pointed out that *padritahi* may be a theophoric name of a city----perhaps a Lycian translation of Aphrodisias in Caria---and that the Xanthos inscription merely refers to altars established in in a separate city bearing pedrita/Aphrodite's name. Whichever the case, pedrita's presence in art and inscriptions attests to the inncreasing influence of Greek mythology and culture in Lyica.<sup>4</sup>
