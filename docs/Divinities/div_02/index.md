# trqqas, *the storm god*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_02`

The god trqqas appears in several inscriptions throughout Lycia. 


The root of his name, *trqqNt-*, shows a direct connection to the Luwian storm-god tarhunt. There is scant evidence in the Lycian inscriptions to point to any characteristic f 


Some scholars have suggested that the Zeus found in Greek inscriptions during the Hellenistic period was actually trqqas under a different name (keen 201). The evidence for this largely comes from two passages on the the Xanthos Stele: 

| TL 44b.62| TL 44c.30 |
|----------|----------|
|*se dde towetE : komeziya : Tere Tere : trqqNti pddAtahi* |*Zηνί δὲ πλεῖστα τροπαῖα βροτῶν ἔστησεν ἁπαντῶν.*|
|"and he has set up altars to the local trqqas thoughout the sanctuaries" (laroche 1980)|"he set up the most trophies to Zeus of all mortals"|

Though not identical, the similar structures suggest a connection between the Greek and Lycian deities. Furthermore, other scholars like Houwink ten Cate equate the cult of Zeus Solymeus in eastern Lycia with the cult of trqqas (bryce 117). Complicating matters, however, is the Lycian name “*zeosi*” which appears on the Xanthos Stele as well. Melchert sees this word a Lycian derivaton of “Zeus,” which raises the question of why the Lycians would have both a Lycianized word for Zeus alongside a native equivalent (Melchert 88).
