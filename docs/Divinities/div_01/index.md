# Eni, *mother of the gods*

Eni's epithets indicate her status in the Lycian pantheon. She is the *Eni mahanahi* (𐊚𐊏𐊆 𐊎𐊀𐊛𐊀𐊏𐊀𐊛𐊆) or the "mother of the gods." She is also a localized deity, with some (which ones) inscriptions refering to her as *Eni qlahi ebiyehi* (𐊚𐊏𐊆 𐊌𐊍𐊀𐊛𐊆 𐊁𐊂𐊆𐊊𐊁𐊛𐊆) or the "mother of this sanctuary."
