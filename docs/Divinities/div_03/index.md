# maliya, *the punisher*

The goddess Maliya (𐊎𐊀𐊍𐊆𐊊𐊀) is one of the most prominent Lycian divinities. She appears in ten separate inscriptions, usually as a disciplinary agent on sepuchral inscriptions. 

Evidence of her cult comes mostly from Xanthos, where the Xanthos stele states that she shared a *hrMma* (𐊛𐊕𐊐𐊎𐊀) with the goddesses ertEmi (𐊁𐊕𐊗𐊚𐊎𐊆) and the xNtawata xbidENi (𐊜𐊑𐊗𐊀𐊇𐊀𐊗𐊀 𐊜𐊂𐊆𐊅𐊚𐊑𐊆). Inscriptions from Rhodiopolis in eastern Lycia suggest that there was a cult of Maliya there as well. 

Probably round the 4th century BCE, Maliya became equated with the Greek goddess Athena. Evidence for this identification comes from a silver double-headed kantharos (N 307) that depicts the goddess Maliya (identified by the inscription "𐊎𐊀𐊍"/"mal") with attributes typical of Athena.
