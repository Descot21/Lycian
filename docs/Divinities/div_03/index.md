# maliya, *the punisher*

The goddess Maliya (𐊎𐊀𐊍𐊆𐊊𐊀) is one of the most prominent Lycian divinities. She appears in ten separate inscriptions, usually as a disciplinary agent on sepuchral inscriptions.

Maliya's origins most likely lie in the Anatolian bronze age. She bares remarkable similarities with the...

Evidence of her cult comes mostly from Xanthos, where the Xanthos stele states that she shared a *hrMma* (𐊛𐊕𐊐𐊎𐊀) with the goddesses ertEmi (𐊁𐊕𐊗𐊚𐊎𐊆) and the xNtawata xbidENi (𐊜𐊑𐊗𐊀𐊇𐊀𐊗𐊀 𐊜𐊂𐊆𐊅𐊚𐊑𐊆). Inscriptions from Rhodiopolis in eastern Lycia indicate that there was a cult of Maliya there as well. In these inscriptions, Maliya bears the epithet *wedrENni* (𐊇𐊁𐊅𐊕𐊚𐊑𐊏𐊆), a complicated term that indicates a defined unit of territory (perhaps similar in function to a Greek deme). The title *maliya wedrENni* (𐊎𐊀𐊍𐊆𐊊𐊀 𐊇𐊁𐊅𐊕𐊚𐊑𐊏𐊆), therefore, might be translated "Maliya of this *wedri*," or "the regional Maliya." The scholar J.D. Hawkins takes this concept a step further and equates the cult of Maliya wedrENni with the cult the Greek Athena Polias.

Probably round the 4th century BCE, Maliya became equated with the Greek goddess Athena. Evidence for this identification comes from a silver double-headed kantharos (N 307) that depicts the goddess Maliya (identified by the inscription "𐊎𐊀𐊍"/"mal") with attributes typical of Athena.
