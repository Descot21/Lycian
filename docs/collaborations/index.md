# Collaborations with other projects

One of the goals of Trmilli Texts is to create a set of resources that can be used by other scholars in various fields. Descriptions and abstracts from various collarbartions will appear on this page.

1.“Integrating Lycian Mythological Data into a Greco-Roman Database: A Collaborative Digital
Initiative,” R. Scott Smith, University of New Hampshire, and Dane Scott & Neel Smith, College of the
Holy Cross.

*Presented at the Classical Association of New England's (CANE) [Annual Conference 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KholBlt7XjO3Y_2aU9zfejORSKTs45K3/view)*

This proposal involves a collaborative effort between two projects MANTO (co-directed by R. S. Smith), an emerging authoritative database for entities and relationships in the Greek mythological story-world, and the Trmilli project (directed by N. Smith), which is creating digital resources for studying the corpus of stone inscriptions preserved in the Lycian language. Within the latter, Dane Scott explores the religious elements of Lycian culture by creating and examining a systematic digital corpus of Lycian inscriptions—one that we hope to tie into MANTO’s ontology. We propose to conduct an experiment using shared identifiers to create interlinked content on the web built from archival data in simple text formats. To a large extent, our paper would derive from the results of this experimental attempt to link specifically the mythological and geographical data in Lycian to the database and ontology of MANTO. We will present the protocols and results, including challenges to linked data between Lycian and Greco-Roman mythologies.

[MANTO](https://manto-myth.org) (Mapping Ancient Narratives, Territories, and Objects) is a relational database which is currently populated by mythological entities and information in a narrow but expanding range of texts. Focused currently on the Greco-Roman world, its ontology was created with Greek myth in mind, but MANTO’s aim was always to be expandable. This is our first trial to include and link to other mythological systems. Trmilli is centered on diplomatic editions of Lycian texts citable by canonical reference (CTS) down to the level of individual words. Interactive web resources built with [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/) read these text files from a public repository on github, and allow users to explore the corpus using the text of the inscriptions, their geographic location, and external identifiers for named entities.
