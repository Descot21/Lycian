**What is Lycian?**

Lycian is an ancient Anatolian language that was spoken in Lycia, a geo-political area in the southwest of modern-day Turkey. Most scholars agree that Lycian has it's origins in Indo-European, closely related to other Anatolian languages like Luwian, Carian, and (distantly) Hittite. It seems that Lycian maintained a strong written presence in Lycia during the 4th and 5th centuries BCE, appearing on stone, tombs, monuments, and coins. But, by the first century, Greek had fully replaced Lycian the sole public and administrative language.  

There are two forms of Lycian that have been discovered: Lycian A (simply called "Lycian") and Milyan (sometimes called Lycian B). Lycian accounts for the majority of texts discovered, while Milyan appears only in a select number of sources, usually from eastern Lycia in the Milyas region. Since Milyan appears in such a small number of sources, it has not been deciphered as well as Lycian. For that reason, Trmilli Texts only deals with texts written in Lycian. 

Lycian has not yet been fully deciphered, but significant strides have been made in recent centuries. The first non-deciphered texts were published by a French archaeological team in 1820, with the Lycian alphabet being deciphered later that year. The first extensive corpus of Lycian inscriptions was published by an Austrian expedition led by Ernest Kalinka in 1901. This corpus, called *Tituli Asiae Minoris: Tituli Lyciae* (shorted to TL in this collection), contianed 152 Lycian inscriptions, including some bilingual Lycian-Greek texts. The next significant publication of Lycian texts was by Guenter Neumann in 1979 called *Neufunde lykischer Inschriften seit 1901* (abbreviated as N in this collection) which was modeled as a continuation of Kalinka's corpus. There have been more recent publications, including a collection of small inscriptions from 2017 that have

I am not the first person to encounter and explore the Lycian language. Many scholars have come before me and produced scholarship on the decipherment and content of the Lycian corpus. This begs the question: why don’t I start where these scholars left off? Why am I bothering to learn Lycian from the ground up, deciphering the letters for myself and utilizing only the primary sources for my work? I’m treating my Lycian project as if it were a science experiment. Just like any good scientist, I am trying to replicate the results of the “experiment” previous Lycian scholars have performed. I am looking in the primary evidence in order to see if the same patterns occur that would lead me to the same result that previous scholars have reached. If I encounter the same results, then their validity remains. If I encounter different results, then the richness of Lycian interpretation is deepened. On top of corroberating previous scholars' work, I am also learning Lycian in this manner in order to become more intimate with the Lycian sources. By deciphering the primary sources themselves, I am able to appreciate the language--idiosyncricies and all--on a deeper level than I would if I were to simply learn the langauge through the secondary sources. And lastly, It's simply an fantastic academic project. I get to delve into a language and culture that stood at the crossroads of civilizations. And I get to do it all in a two-semester project as well! I am deeply excited to continue my exploration of Lycian and to see what this fascinating language and culture has to offer.
