# Introduction to site 

I am not the first person to encounter and explore the Lycian language. Many scholars have come before me and produced scholarship on the decipherment and content of the Lycian corpus. This begs the question: why don’t I start where these scholars left off? Why am I bothering to learn Lycian from the ground up, deciphering the letters for myself and utilizing only the primary sources for my work? I’m treating my Lycian project as if it were a science experiment. Just like any good scientist, I am trying to replicate the results of the “experiment” previous Lycian scholars have performed. I am looking in the primary evidence in order to see if the same patterns occur that would lead me to the same result that previous scholars have reached. If I encounter the same results, then their validity remains. If I encounter different results, then the richness of Lycian interpretation is deepened. On top of corroberating previous scholars' work, I am also learning Lycian in this manner in order to become more intimate with the Lycian sources. By deciphering the primary sources themselves, I am able to appreciate the language--idiosyncricies and all--on a deeper level than I would if I were to simply learn the langauge through the secondary sources. And lastly, It's simply an fantastic academic project. I get to delve into a language and culture that stood at the crossroads of civilizations. And I get to do it all in a two-semester project as well! I am deeply excited to continue my exploration of Lyciand and to see what this fascinating language and culture has to offer.
