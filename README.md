# Lycian

This repository hosts work on a systematic digital corpus of Lycian texts.  The website for this project can be found here: https://descot21.github.io/Lycian/

To assemble a jekyll web site from all the components of this repository, run `julia buildsite.jl` in this directory. The resulting web pages are written in the `offline` directory.  If you have jekyll installed on your system, you can run a [jekyll web server](https://jekyllrb.com) in the `offline` directory with `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and open a web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
