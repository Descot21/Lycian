Introduction - "what's the focus"
  buiding on top of the tutorial
  summarize highlights from this fall tutorial (decipherment of script / identifying morphological features / recogmizing standard formulaic langauge in funerary texts /       started the process of XML editing that are tied to canoncially cited images) 
  
  
Define concrete things - expanding the edited corpus / building out a model of the morphological analyses / building out a digital lexicon--> coordinating all three of these with canonical citation. 
Developing digital data sets which give us contexual information about each epigraphic source

"perseus project for Lycian" 

revisit questions about Lycian religion --> can we use digital corpus and archaeological evidence to craft a picture of Lycian religious/burial practice (e.g. tombs in middle of sanctuary)....different perspective on Lycian religion!!

Bibliographic listing --> put in Bib file in git (Bryce and Keen) surveying the research since these two monographs. Offer an up-to-date annotated Bibliography
