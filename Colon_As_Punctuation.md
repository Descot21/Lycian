 The Lycian colon ![:](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/lycian/hc/v1/2007.02.0020.tif&RGN=0.2717,0.05695,0.02367,0.1859&wID=20&CVT=JPEG) acts as a punctuation mark or a word-separator. It does not appear in every Lycian inscription, but it is ubiquitous enough to be given special attention. The first clue that this symbol might be a punctuation mark instead of an alphabetical sign is its resemblance to the modern colon (“:”) and Archaic Greek punctuation. [example of Ancient Greek punctuation here.] The Lycian alphabet shares many similarities with the Greek alphabet--and these two societies clearly interacted based on the number of bilingual texts--so it is plausible that the Lycian value for the colon parallels the Greek value. Of course, the Lycian values of the Lycian alphabet differ from the Greek values. The Lycian E /i/ does not have the same value as the Greek E /e/. The Lycians could have reassigned a value to the colon that better fitted their language needs. This is unlikely based on the position of the colon in the epigraphic corpus. The Lycian colon bounds units of characters frequently throughout the text. Although it is too early to assume the colon bounds single words specifically, it seems likely. For example, the Greek text of [TL 117](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:lycian:hc.v1:2007.02.0004@0.3348,0.6471,0.3153,0.1259&urn=urn:cite2:lycian:hc.v1:2007.02.0004@0.4512,0.1713,0.3326,0.1171) contains the Greek name _ΣΙΔΑΡΙΟΣ_ and the Lycian equivalent _siderije_. The Lycian word is bounded on either side by a colon. Furthemore, this repeating unit [28-idei-15-i](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:lycian:hc.v1:2007.02.0004@0.1251,0.2826,0.3131,0.1259&urn=urn:cite2:lycian:hc.v1:2007.02.0004@0.3717,0.4114,0.3897,0.1464) appears twice in the text, both times bounded by colons. The second instance of this example, a letter-unit _se_ is connected to the word. Based on the number of Lycian units that repeat in TL 117, it is likely that this word means “and” and could be connected to the word much like the Latin _-que_. Regardless, it is clear that the colon is used to distinguish one Lycian unit from another. Below is a sampling of the colon in Lycian inscriptions.
