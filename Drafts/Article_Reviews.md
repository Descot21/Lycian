**Molina Valero (2007)**

Within his article “Reading Lycian Through Greek Eyes: The Vowel,” Carlos Molina Volero attempts to redefine the phonetic values of Lycian vowels. To do so, Molina Valero compares Lycian and Greek bilingual personal names found in the epigraphic corpus. Because the values of the Greek vowels are well known and well attested, Molina Valero will use them as a starting point to identify potential values for the Lycian vowels. Molina Valero begins by analyzing the four vowels and two nasal vowels that Craig Melchert identified. They are: [a], [e], [i], [o], and [ã] and [ẽ]. These correspond to 𐊀, 𐊁, 𐊆, 𐊒, and 𐊙, and 𐊚 respectively. Traditionally, these have been their phonetic vowels: 
| Letter |  Transcription  |    Phonetic Value   | 
|---|------- |--------|
| 𐊀 | [a]    |    a   |
| 𐊁 | [e]    |    e   |
| 𐊆 | [i]    |    i  |
| 𐊒 | [o]    |    u   |

Molina Valero goes through each Lycian vowel and identifies Lycian names that use the character and compares it to it’s Greek equivalent. Molina Valero only focuses on the four unnazalized vowels in his dicussion. After the presentation of the data, Molina Valero concludes that the values of the vowels reflect this paradigm: 
| Letter |  Transcription  |    Phonetic Value   | 
|---|------- |--------|
| 𐊀 | [a]    |    ɑ   |
| 𐊁 | [e]    |    æ   |
| 𐊆 | [i]    |    i  |
| 𐊒 | [o]    |    o   |

This paradigm suggests that the Lycian vowels are more open than previously thought. Though Molina Valero argues that [u] is not represented by a single letter, he suggest that it could make an apparence in certain diphthongs, especially due to the presence of [w]. He also argues that the value [æ] is a better description of 𐊁 because this Symbol represents both the greek α, ε, and η. Overall, I think this is a good system.   

**Kloekhorst (2008)**

Alwin Kloekhorst’s article “Studies in Lycian and Carian Phonology and Morphology” reexamines the phonetic values of Lycian letters using comparative Linguistics with Luwian, Hittite, and other related Anatolian languages. Kloekhorst begins by sketching out Lycian’s place in the Anatolian branch of PIE and gives a brief linguistic rundown of Lycian’s similarities with Luwian, Lydian and Hittite. Then, Kloekhorst goes through each Lycian letter and provides evidence and arguments for it’s phonetic value. For the most part, Kloekhorst agrees with previous linguists like Craig Melchert, although he does provide some alternative values. The values that Kloekhorst proposes can be found on the updated [Alphabet Chart](https://github.com/Descot21/Lycian/blob/master/Alphabet/Alphabet_Chart.md) in this repository. After going through each letter, Kloekhorst turns to two words: _sitEni_ and _ebENnE_ and discusses their debated morphological and syntactical elements. Kloekhorst then begins by discussing elements of the Carian language, and ends his article with a chart depicting the historical developments from Proto Anatolian to Lycian and Carian.
