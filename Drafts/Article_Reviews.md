**Molina Valero (2007)**

Within his article “Reading Lycian Through Greek Eyes: The Vowel,” Carlos Molina Volero attempts to redefine the phonetic values of Lycian vowels. To do so, Molina Valero compares Lycian and Greek bilingual personal names found in the epigraphic corpus. Because the values of the Greek vowels are well known and well attested, Molina Valero will use them as a starting point to identify potential values for the Lycian vowels. Molina Valero begins by analyzing the four vowels and two nasal vowels that Craig Melchert identified. They are: [a], [e], [i], [o], and [ã] and [ẽ]. These correspond to C, 𐊁, 𐊆, 𐊒, and 𐊙, and 𐊚 respectively. Molina Valero goes through each Lycian vowel and identifies Lycian names that use the character and compares it to it’s Greek equivalent. After the presentation of the data, Molina Valero concludes that the values of the vowels reflect this paradigm: 
| Letter |  Transcription  |    Phonetic Value   |
|---|------- |--------|
| - | [a]    |    ɑ   |
| 𐊁 | [e]    |    æ   |
| 𐊆 | [i]    |    i  |
| 𐊒 | [o]    |    o   |
