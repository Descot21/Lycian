I am not the first person to encounter and explore the Lycian language. Many scholars have come before me and produced scholarship on the decipherment and content of the Lycian corpus. This begs the question: why don’t I start where these scholars left off? Why am I bothering to learn Lycian from the ground up, deciphering the letters for myself and utilizing only the primary sources for my work? 
I’m treating my Lycian project as if it were a science experiment. Just like any good scientist, I am trying to replicate the results of the “experiment” previous Lycian scholars have performed. I am looking in the primary evidence in order to see if the same patterns occur that would lead me to the same result that previous scholars have reached. If I encounter the same results, then their validity remains. If I encounter different results, then the richness of Lycian interpretation is deepened.
