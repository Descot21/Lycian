Dane Scott is a fourth-year student at the College of the Holy Cross. Originally from San Diego, CA, Dane is completing a major in classics and a minor in religious studies. Dane is especially interested in the materiality and practices of ancient Mediterranean religions. His upcoming senior project will explore the religious elements of Lycian culture by creating and examining a systematic digital corpus of Lycian epigraphs. He hopes that this project will provide and updated picture of Lycian religion and be a useful tool for students and professionals alike.
