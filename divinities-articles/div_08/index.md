# erBBazoma

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_08`

The divinity erBBazoma (𐊁𐊕𐊃𐊃𐊀𐊈𐊒𐊎𐊀) appears in the Letoon trilingual as a the companion of the xNtawata xbidENi (𐊜𐊑𐊗𐊀𐊇𐊀𐊗𐊀 𐊜𐊂𐊆𐊅𐊚𐊑𐊆). The triligual enumerates the procedure for establishing the cults of erBBazoma and the xNtawata xbidENi at the Letoon during the reign of the satrap Pixodarus (pigesere / 𐊓𐊆𐊄𐊁𐊖𐊁𐊕𐊁), and the appointment of eseimiya (𐊁𐊖𐊁𐊆𐊎𐊆𐊊𐊀) and his descendants as priests of their cults.<sup>1</sup> Nothing difinitive is known about this deity; scholars like Laroche believe erBBazoma was originally a Kaunian divinity, whereas others like Heubeck believe the deity is Greek in origin.<sup>2</sup> The trilingual's Greek text gives the god's name as 'Αρκεσιμας, whcih closely mirrors the Lycian name. 

Though nothing is known about the character of this deity, erBBazoma's name is helpful in deciphering the values for Lycian graphemes. The letter 𐊃 (transcribed as "B" in our system) is found only in three inscriptions from around Xanthos.<sup>3</sup> It has no equivalence in the Greek alphabet, but the transcription with κ in 'Αρκεσιμας, and it's increased frequency in "gutteral" Milyan words has helped linguists like Kloekhorst give 𐊃 the value of /ç/.<sup>4</sup>
