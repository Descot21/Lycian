# eliyAna, *spirits of water*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_07`

The eliyAna only appear in the Letoon trilingual where they are invoked along side Eni and her children (presumably the Letoids Artemis and Apollo) as disciplinary agents against anyone who might violate the trilingual's inscription. The eliyAna were water spirits that were perhaps not too dissimilar to the naiads and water nymphs of Greek religion. This is supported by their equasin with the νύμφαι/nymphs in the Greek portion of the trilingual, and the the Luwian root of their name, *ali-h<sub>3</sub>on-* "having water." The eliyAna presence in the Letoon furthers the theory that early cult functions around Xanthos were centered around a spring sanctuary. J

Jennifer Larson belives that cult of the eliyAna was probably not all that different from the nymphs in Greek religion. 

The letoon was originally a spirng sanctuary where the eliyAna and Eni were worshiped togther.
