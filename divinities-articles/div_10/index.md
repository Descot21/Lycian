# natri, *The Lycian Apollo*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_10`

The prescence of the theophoric name natrbbiyEmi (𐊏𐊀𐊗𐊕𐊂𐊂𐊆𐊊𐊚𐊎𐊆) and it's Greek counterpart Apollodotos (Ἀπολλόδοτος) in the Letoon trilingual has lead scholars to identify natr(i)- (𐊏𐊀𐊗𐊕𐊆) with Apollo. Bryce points out that natrbbiyEmi seems to be a direct translation of the Greek name, with the ending *-bbiyEmi* / *-piyEmi* (a past participle of the verb *piye-* "to give") reflecting the *dotos* in Apollodotos.<sup>1</sup> The name natri does appear on the Xanthos stele as well, this time accompanied by the epithet *toraxssi* (𐊗𐊒𐊕𐊀𐊜𐊖𐊖𐊆). Neumann equates this term with θυρξεύς, an epithet given to Apollo at Kyaneae.<sup>2</sup>

Κυανεῶν δὲ τῶν πρὸς Λυκίᾳ πλησιαίτατα χρηστήριον **Ἀπόλλωνός** ἐστι **Θυρξέως**: παρέχεται δὲ ὕδωρ τὸ πρὸς ταῖς Κυανέαις ἔσω ἐνιδόντα τινὰ ἐς τὴν πηγὴν ὁμοίως πάντα ὁπόσα θέλει θεάσασθαι. | Close to Kyaneae by Lycia, where there is an oracle of **Apollo Thyrxeus**, the water shows to him who looks into the spring all the things that he wants to behold.


Bryce cautions that natri's identification with Apollo---and even his identification as a divinity---is built upon a "series of conjectures" and that his indentifications should be treated as such.<sup>3</sup> If indeed natri was a native Lycian deity, he certainly was not as popular as other Lycian divinities. It seems strange that the Lycians would have equated such a popular god as Apollo with a less popular divinity, especially since the Greek world was associating Apollo with Lycia as early as the 8th century in the Homeric epics.
