# qeli, *the goddess of grain*


`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_05`

qeli's (𐊌𐊁𐊍𐊆) name only appears once in the surviving corpus in the genitive *qelehi*. This sepuchral inscription (N322) was discovered in Pinara, and denotes the tomb owner, pEmodiya (𐊓𐊚𐊎𐊒𐊅𐊆𐊊𐊀), as a priest of qeli.<sup>1</sup> Neumann suggests that the name qeli might date back to the Bronze Age, and may relate with the Hittite grain goddess Halki.<sup>2</sup> This Hittite goddess was specifically the patron of barley, and was honored as a fertility spirit and a *hãyamma* ("queen").<sup>3</sup> Whether or not the Lycian qeli shared any of these characteristcs with her Bronze Age ancestor is impossible to tell with the current state of the surviving corpus.
