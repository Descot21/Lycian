# Eni, *mother of the gods*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_01`

Based on the number of her occurrences in the surviving Lycian inscriptions, Eni holds a premier station within the Lycian religious system. Although the inscriptions provide no information as to Eni’s mythology, her common epithets paint a picture of her character as a goddess. She is often termed the *Eni mahanahi* (𐊚𐊏𐊆 𐊎𐊀𐊛𐊀𐊏𐊀𐊛𐊆) or the "mother of the gods," which ties her directly to the Luwian “mother of the gods” *anniš maššanaššiš*. As such, Eni’s origins probably lie with a pre-Bronze Age or prehistoric Anatolian mother goddess---the same female divinity identified at Çatal Höyük who became Kybele in the western Anatolia and Artemis at Ephesus.(Keen 195, Raimond 2). 

Like most Lycian divinities, Eni appears most often in sepulchral inscriptions as a protective deity. Unlike maliya and trqqas, who are mainly agents of vengeance, Eni’s role in these inscriptions is slightly more diverse. In some inscriptions, she is invoked to “destroy” (*qastto*) tomb violators, while in others she is invoked as the goddess to whose sanctuary violators will have to pay fines:

Along with being a mother goddess, Eni is also a localized goddess. Some inscriptions referring to her as *Eni qlahi ebiyehi* (𐊚𐊏𐊆 𐊌𐊍𐊀𐊛𐊆 𐊁𐊂𐊆𐊊𐊁𐊛𐊆) or the "mother of this sanctuary." The most notable *qla* of Eni is the Letoon outside of Xanthos. This sanctuary probably dates back to the end of the second millenium BCE, and was of great importance to the Lycians, especially in the Hellenistic period when it became the national sanctuary of the Lycian League. The sanctuary recieved it's name in the Hellenistic period, after the introduction of the cult of Leto and her children, Apollo and Artemis. Most scholars agree that Letoon originally belonged to the cult of Eni (or the Luwian *anniš*), but later assimilated with Leto after her introduction in Lycia. More about Leto's presence in Lycian epichoric inscriptions can be found in the page "leθθe."

In the 1970s, the archaeologist G. E. Bean discovered an anthropomorphic scupture probbaly dating to the end of the 7th century BCE in the Letoon. Bean's descriptions reads: 

>"The curious statue was found by us lying on top of a hedge near the theatre. It is 0.96 m. in hight an 0.43 m. in maximum breadth; the trunk is cut off a little below the waist. The back is flat, but quite rough. The figure is female, with hair tied back with a bandeau; the face is round, with large eyes; the nose is long and straight, with a straight groove down either side of it; the cars are shapeless lumps. The neck is left thick, and the arms are mere stumps projecting forward. The material is a curious variegated grey- and- white limestone, highly unsuitable for its purpose..."(insert pages)

Bean goes on to suggest that the statue was merely a students unfinsihed model, and not something of great religious importance. However, the scholar Fahri Işık argues that the statue could be a cult image of Eni mahanahi, and that it's archaism or unfinished appearence is actually a common Anatolian art form dating back to the netholic period. Similar statues of Kybele and other Anatolian goddesses have been found at Gordion, Keskaya, and Hattusa. It's discovery at the Letoon furthers the notion that the statue might have been of cultic value, and that it represented the Lycian mother goddess associated with the sanctuary.
