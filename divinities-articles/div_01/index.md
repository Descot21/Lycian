# Eni, *mother of the gods*

`urn:cite2:trmilli:divinities.v1:div_01`

Based on the number of her occurrences in the surviving Lycian inscriptions, Eni holds a premier station within the Lycian religious system. Although the inscriptions provide no information as to Eni’s mythology, her common epithets paint a picture of her character as a goddess. She is often termed the *Eni mahanahi* (𐊚𐊏𐊆 𐊎𐊀𐊛𐊀𐊏𐊀𐊛𐊆) or the "mother of the gods," which ties her directly to the Luwian “mother of the gods” *anniš maššanaššiš*. As such, Eni’s origins probably lie with a pre-Bronze Age or prehistoric Anatolian mother goddess---the same female divinity identified at Çatal Höyük who became Kybele in the western Anatolia and Artemis at Ephesus.(Keen 195, Raimond 2). 

Like most Lycian divinities, Eni appears most often in sepulchral inscriptions as a protective deity. Unlike maliya and trqqas who are mainly agents of vengeance, Eni’s role in these inscriptions is slightly more diverse. In some inscriptions, she is invoked to “destroy” (qastto) tomb violators, while in others she is invoked as the goddess to whose sanctuary violators will have to pay fines:

Along with being a mother goddess, Eni is also a localized goddess, with some inscriptions referring to her as *Eni qlahi ebiyehi* (𐊚𐊏𐊆 𐊌𐊍𐊀𐊛𐊆 𐊁𐊂𐊆𐊊𐊁𐊛𐊆) or the "mother of this sanctuary." The most notable *qla* of Eni is the Letoon outside of Xanthos. This sanctuary probably dates back to the sixth or seventh century BCE, and was of great importance, especially in the Hellenistic period when it became the national sanctuary of the Lycian League.
