siderije = ΣΙΔΑΡΙΟΣ
pubieleje = ΠΥΒΙΑΛΗ
perm_ne = ΠΑΡΜΕΝΟΝΤΟΣ
tideimi = ΥΙΟΣ/ΥΙΩΙ (son)
ladi = ΓΥΝ(A)ΙΚΙ (wife)
se = KAI

ebeija = erawazija : meti : prNnawatE = ΤΟ ΜΝΗΜΑ ΤΟΔ' ΕΠΟΙΗΣΑΤΟ
ebeija = TO or ΤΟΔ'-- demonstrative
erawazija = ΜΝΗΜΑ
meti = ?
prNnawatE = ΕΠΟΙΗΣΑΤΟ
e-28-bi = for? (e.g. for his wife / for his son). e-28-bi occures both as a separated word (line 4) and as a unit in a word (line 3). Perhaps this is a particle that can be combined with words or stand on its own like se.  
_rppi = ΕΑΥΤΩΙ?

ebENnE : 29-up-26 : mEti : prNnawatE : e-29-eteija
28-rppi : atli : e-28-bi : se : ladi : e-28-bi : se : tideimi

ebENnE = demonstrative again. Different form/inflection

e-29-eteija = probably a proper name. It's the fifth word in the sentence, which mirrors _siderije_. Plus they both have the same _ija_ endinginflectional ending?

Translation = "e-29-eteija constructed this monument for himself, his wife, and his son" 

26 is probably a nasalized sound, because it causes nazalization in the words that follow it (e.g. mEti vs meti)

**TL 52**

ebENnE : prNnawu : mEn
eprNnawatE : 28-anadaza : 28-rp
piladi : ebbi : se tideime

28-anadaza is in the fifth position. Most likely the proper name of the person who built the tomb? 
piladi = contains _ladi_/wife. Perhaps _pi_ is a prepositon? 
prNnawu/eprNnawatE = these words contain the same "_prNnaw_" unit. Probably different conjugations of "contruct" 
mEn = ? a particle like greek μεν? 
28-rp = _rppi/_rppi = ΕΑΥΤΩΙ?
